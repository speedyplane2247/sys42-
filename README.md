# sys42X
Windows 93 Kernel Extension
### Naming
sys42 is short system42, which is the kernel of Windows 93.

sys42eXtension

## How to use?
Right now the only way to use is with noX3 or MX, and I know I am planning to release noX3 shortly, which can load kernel images.
### Static Hosting
You also could use static hosting, and sys42X will support it.
